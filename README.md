# My Open-Sourced Class Notes

## Intro

Starting from 2016 spring semester, I started to take class notes with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Markdown is rather simple and enables me to take notes quickly and efficiently.

This is the repo where I put my notes. If you're my classmate, you're very welcome to contribute to my notes.

## How To View the Notes (.md files)?

Markdown files are stored in pure text format. To read formatted notes you need a Markdown editor or Markdown renderer. Currently I'm using [Typora](https://www.typora.io/), an elegant and lightweight Markdown editor (and renderer at the same time! It also supports Latex!).

Github also renders *.md* files on their webpage, but it doesn't support **Latex** in Markdown now. But it is good to get a quick look.

## Contribution Guide

- If you don't know how to use git or markdown, just create an [issue](https://github.com/shavvn/class-notes/issues) and tell me what you think. e.g. typos, contents to correct, photos to add, etc.
- Otherwise you can always create a pull request.
